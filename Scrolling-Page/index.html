        <p>
            After acquiring the Power Gem that had been left in the custody of the Nova Corps on the planet Xandar, the
            evil intergalactic titan Thanos intercepts the spacecraft carrying the survivors of Asgard's destruction and
            attacks it. During the assault on the ship, Thanos and her lieutenants, Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima
            Midnight, and Corvus Glaive, exterminate half of the crew. Thanos subdues Thor and threatens Loki to kill
            his adoptive brother if he does not give him the Tesseract, at first Loki pretends that he does not care
            about his brother's life, but seeing Thanos' determination, he yields to the pressure and shows him the
            Tesseract to buy time until the Hulk arrives and begins to fight the alien warrior, however, the titan
            proved to have more skill in hand-to-hand fighting and quickly defeats the Hulk. Seeing this, Heimdall who
            was badly injured on the ground uses what he has left of dark energy to send Bruce Banner / Hulk back to
            Earth invoking the Bifröst, which angered Thanos and in retaliation assassinated Heimdall. Then extract the
            Gem from the Tesseract Space and kill Loki. Once he has done his job, Thanos leaves with his lieutenants and
            destroys the spaceship.

            Meanwhile, the Hulk forcibly lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, transforming into Bruce Banner
            and warning Doctor Strange and Wong that Thanos is coming in search of the Infinity Stones. In order to face
            the imminent threat, Strange goes to Tony Stark / Iron Man requesting his collaboration and brings him to
            the Sanctum Sanctorum. There, he and Wong talk to him about the Infinity Stones and inform him that Strange
            is in charge of taking care of the Time Stone, Bruce tells Tony that Thanos is heading towards Earth to
            carry out his plan to assassinate half of the living creatures in the universe, then Tony argues with Doctor
            Strange about whether they should destroy the Time Stone and Bruce tells Tony that they have to find their
            companion Vision as he is the bearer of the Mind Stone. Tony says that he lost all communication with Vision
            and that the only one who could locate him is Steve Rogers, but shows his disgust at the idea of
            ​​communicating with him after the confrontation they had in Siberia, finally Bruce persuades him. But when
            Tony was preparing to call Rogers with the mobile phone that he received by mail long ago, Maw and Obsidian
            arrive to take the Time Gem from Strange, and they have a fight that catches the attention of Peter Parker /
            Spider⁠-⁠ Man. Maw captures Doctor Strange, but fails to remove the Time Stone due to an enchantment. Iron
            Man and Iron Spider chase Maw's spaceship, while Bruce Banner contacts Steve Rogers with the old mobile
            phone and Wong for his part remains to protect the Sanctum Sanctorum.

            In Scotland, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision to obtain the Mind Gem on Vision's
            forehead. Rogers, Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow and Sam Wilson / Falcon rescue them and take refuge with
            James Rhodes and Bruce at the Avengers complex. Vision offers to sacrifice herself by having Wanda destroy
            the Mind Gem on her head to prevent Thanos from obtaining it. However, Rogers suggests they travel to
            Wakanda, where he believes they have the resources to subtract the gem without destroying Vision.

            In outer space, the Guardians of the Galaxy respond to a distress call issued by the Asgardian ship before
            being destroyed and rescue Thor, who was floating among the wreckage of the ship. After being rescued,
            Gamora tells her about Thanos and her ambition to gather the Infinity Stones to end half of all life forms.
            Thor mentions to them that Thanos is in search of the Reality Stone, which is in possession of the
            intergalactic collector Taneleer Tivan in Knowhere, however Thor intends to go to Nidavellir to forge a new
            weapon, Rocket Raccoon was very Interested in knowing that place of legend and he accompanies Thor along
            with Groot, while the rest of the guardians go to Knowhere, to try to prevent Thanos from taking over the
            Reality Stone.

            Rocket, Groot, and Thor arrive at the legendary Nidavellir space base somewhere in the cosmos. Upon landing
            they discover that the star that feeds the base forge is frozen and that the place is deserted, when they
            realize that there is a model of Thanos' glove in the workshop, Thor sensing the worst, tells Groot and
            Rocket that They leave the base, but before they could escape, the great dwarf king Eitri appears and
            attacks them from behind, altered by the tragedy that just happened recently. Thor asks him to stop but
            Eitri is filled with anger and anguish that his allies, the Asgardians, did not protect his people when
            Nidavellir was attacked by Thanos' forces. After Thor informs him that the kingdom of Asgard no longer
            exists, Eitri shocked, tells Thor that he was forced to forge Thanos a tool capable of containing the power
            of the Infinity Stones believing that it was the only way Thanos He spared his life and the three hundred
            dwarves who lived at the base. But the ruthless titan killed all the inhabitants of Nidavellir and burned
            the dwarf king's hands. However Thor encourages Eitri not to lose hope by telling him that he still has the
            knowledge to make weapons and proposes to join forces to forge a new magical weapon with which to defeat
            Thanos. Thor and Rocket manage to relight the neutron star that keeps the ring-shaped base going, but the
            conduit that channels the star's energy is damaged and the forge doesn't work preventing them from melting
            the metal to forge the new weapon. Thor aware that he will never be able to defeat Thanos without his new
            ax, he has nothing left to do but risk his life. With his great strength, Thor manages to keep the conduit
            open but his body is exposed to the ardor of the star and he was about to die burned, however they manage to
            create the battle ax capable of killing Thanos called the Stormbreaker and the powers of Thor are
            revitalized.

            guardians stayed hidden watching him from a distance and waited for the right moment to attack, but Thanos
            heard them when Drax impulsively tried to get out of his hiding place to face him, so Gamora decides to
            directly fight the titan and manages to hit him with two stab wounds, causing him death, but It was a double
            of an alternate reality, which disappears revealing that Thanos had already destroyed the place before they
            arrived and created that alternate reality with the power of the Reality Stone as a lure to attract Gamora.
            Thanos then kidnaps Gamora and she reveals the location of the Soul Gem to save her foster sister Nebula
            from torture. Thanos and Gamora travel to the desolate planet Vormir, where Red Skull, guardian of the Soul
            Gem, informs them that the gem can only be obtained by sacrificing a loved one. Thanos sacrifices his
            adoptive daughter, Gamora with anguish, throwing her into the void, then he is teleported to the place on

            spotting just one in which they manage to beat him. Thanos arrives and justifies her plans stating that they
            are necessary to guarantee the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation. The group subdues him
            until Nebula deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Star-Lord attacks him, allowing Thanos to break
            control of the group and defeat them. Iron Man ends up seriously wounded by Thanos, but later Doctor Strange
            decides to give in and makes the exchange of the Time Gem to Thanos for the life of Stark.

            hands, plucking the gem from his head.

            wounding him despite Thanos trying to repel the attack with the power of the glove. However, when Thor was
            preparing to kill him, Thanos managed to activate the full power of the Infinity Gauntlet by snapping his
